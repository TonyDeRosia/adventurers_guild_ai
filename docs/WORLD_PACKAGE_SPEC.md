# Smart MUD World Package Specification

Smart MUD worlds are installable data packages under `worlds/<world_id>/`. The engine loads packages; it does not contain world lore, races, classes, NPCs, items, quests, rooms, spells, factions, or genre assumptions.

## Required runtime package content

Every package must contain `manifest.json` and these runtime gameplay/content directories:

- `rules/`
- `areas/`
- `rooms/`
- `zones/`
- `npcs/`
- `items/`
- `quests/`
- `shops/`
- `trainers/`
- `classes/`
- `races/`
- `skills/`
- `spells/`
- `abilities/`
- `factions/`
- `lore/`
- `dialogue/`
- `intelligence/`
- `colors/`

Missing runtime gameplay/content folders are fatal validation errors.

## Auto-created Builder workspace

Builder workspace directories are runtime-prepared infrastructure, not gameplay assets and not fatal install requirements. Startup and registry validation create these folders when missing:

- `builder/`
- `builder/audit/`
- `builder/history/`
- `builder/snapshots/`
- `builder/imports/`
- `builder/exports/`
- `builder/templates/`

## Manifest authority

The manifest is the authority for loading a world. Required fields are: `world_id`, `display_name`, `author`, `description`, `version`, `engine_version_required`, `minimum_engine_version`, `maximum_engine_version`, `dependencies`, `required_plugins`, `optional_plugins`, `world_type`, `default_starting_area`, `default_starting_room`, `supported_languages`, `supported_character_slots`, `builder`, `load_priority`, and `package_guid`.

`world_type` is descriptive metadata only. The engine never branches by genre.

## Validation

Before loading, Smart MUD refuses invalid packages with descriptive errors. Validation checks required runtime folders, manifest fields, duplicate package IDs, exits to valid rooms, NPC room references, item template references, quest NPC references, trainer class references, spell schools, class abilities, and race records. Builder workspace folders are prepared automatically and are never fatal validation errors.

## Phase 4A Builder Foundation

Smart MUD supports an in-game Builder foundation for authorized `builder`, `admin`, and `owner` roles. Builder commands are registered in the command registry and are hidden from normal players. Draft edits are persisted under `worlds/<world_id>/builder/` rather than being written directly to live world package files.

The Builder workspace uses `audit`, `history`, `snapshots`, `exports`, `imports`, and `templates` folders. Room, exit, feature, item template, entity template, and spawn edits go through Builder services so runtime validation and permission checks remain authoritative. `builder validate` checks draft consistency; `builder save` creates a safe export; `builder reload` reloads drafts where safe; `builder snapshot` captures the current draft state; and `builder history` reads audit records.

Future work may add a richer semantic web Builder UI and AI-assisted Builder tools, but Phase 4A intentionally does not add AI Builder, combat, quests, shops, or spellcasting.

## Phase 4B Builder runtime navigation note

Builder-created draft rooms now participate in a runtime world graph overlay for builder/admin/owner users with Builder Mode enabled. Runtime lookup merges live world package rooms with BuilderWorkspace drafts, with drafts overriding live rooms for builders only. `goto`, `look`, `rooms`/`rlist`, `rfind`/`rsearch`, `dig`, `link`, `unlink`, and `map`/`rmap` use this merged lookup and the canonical room renderer. Normal players do not see builder-only metadata or draft-only rooms. Draft saves export BuilderWorkspace content; promotion to live packages is not implemented yet. See `docs/BUILDER_NAVIGATION.md`.

## Smart MUD Phase 4C Builder Workflow 2.0

Phase 4C standardizes Builder Mode around a canonical room graph: live world rooms are merged with draft rooms for authorized builders, while normal players continue to see only live package content. Room rendering, look/exits, movement, goto, dig, link/unlink, map/rmap, and builder validation are required to use that shared graph so displayed exits match traversable exits.

Builder commands maintain an explicit editing context and print a `Currently editing:` block for room-editing workflows. `rname` and `rdesc` edit only the selected room target. Room ids must be safe lowercase underscore ids; room names may contain spaces. The primary workflow is `dig <direction> <room_id> ["Room Name"] [--one-way]`, with self-loops blocked unless explicitly allowed. Known limits: visual Builder UI, AI Builder, combat, shops, quests, and spellcasting remain future work and are not introduced by this phase.

## Builder draft room normalization

Builder draft rooms exported from `builder/exports/` are normalized workspace records. Each draft room includes `id`, `name`, `description`, `world_id`, `area_id`, `zone_id`, `exits`, `features`, `flags`, `tags`, and `plugin_data`. Missing fields in old partial drafts are filled with safe defaults before save/export. This normalization applies to builder drafts only; live package files are not changed by builder save/export.

## Phase 4E Area, Zone, and VNUM Organization

Builder Mode now supports draft areas and zones before room creation. Builders can use `acreate`/`aset current`, `zcreate`/`zset current`, `rcreate <vnum>`, and `dig <direction> <vnum>` to create rooms with canonical `<area_id>_<vnum>` IDs while preserving explicit `custom` legacy room IDs. Builder status shows world, area, zone, location, edit target, and dirty state. Builder export includes `areas`, `zones`, `rooms`, `items`, `entities`, and `spawns`; validation warns on legacy loose rooms and checks area/zone/vnum consistency. See `docs/AREA_ZONE_VNUM_SYSTEM.md`.

## Phase 4E organized room workflow hotfix

Builders can now finish the practical area/zone/vnum workflow without mutating live world package files. Draft exports remain under the builder workspace.

Canonical workflow:

```text
builder on
acreate test_area 100 110 "Test Area"
zcreate test_zone 100 110 "Test Zone"
rcreate 101
rname Test Room 101
rdesc This room belongs to the test zone.
rooms area test_area
rooms unassigned
rassign test_two area current zone current vnum 102
builder validate
builder save
builder export
```

Operational commands:

- `aset current <area_id>` selects the current area and shows the Builder HUD. If the selected area does not contain the current zone, the current zone is cleared.
- `zset current <zone_id>` selects the zone and also selects that zone's parent area.
- `rcreate <vnum>` creates an organized draft room with `area_id`, `zone_id`, and `vnum` from the current area and zone. It rejects duplicate vnums and out-of-range vnums with guidance.
- `dig <direction> <vnum> "Name"` creates an organized linked draft room using the current area and zone and reports the created room plus both link directions.
- `rooms unassigned` and `rooms legacy` list loose draft rooms where `area_id` and `zone_id` are blank and `vnum` is null. Legacy rooms are warnings, not validation failures.
- `rassign <here|room_id> area <area_id|current> zone <zone_id|current> vnum <number>` explicitly assigns a loose or existing room to an area, zone, and vnum.
- `rmove <here|room_id> [area <area_id>] zone <zone_id> vnum <number>` moves an assigned room to another zone/vnum. If the room was unassigned, it uses the assignment workflow and says so.
- Assigned rooms keep their existing room IDs in Phase 4E. The generated convention is `<area_id>_<vnum>`, and Builder warns when the current ID does not match it.
- `rrenameid <room_id> <new_room_id>` is registered as a placeholder only. Safe room ID migration is deferred because exits, spawns, builder history, and other references must be rewritten atomically.
- `builder export`, `build export`, `builder save`, `build save`, `bsave`, `wsave`, and `asave changed` route to the safe builder export/save behavior.

`builder status`, `astat`, `zstat`, and `rstat` should be used as guidance screens: they show current area, current zone, current room, edit target, room organization status, vnum, and the next suggested `rassign` command for legacy rooms.

`builder validate` groups Errors, Warnings, and Info. Organization warnings include legacy loose rooms, assigned room ID convention mismatches, rooms missing vnums, empty areas/zones, and range overlaps. Organization errors include missing referenced areas/zones, duplicate vnums within an area, out-of-range room vnums, and zone/area mismatches.

## Phase 4F Starter Migration and Builder Import

`builder migrate starter` snapshots the Builder workspace, reads the live Shattered Realms starter package, and writes normalized Builder drafts with `starter_guildlands`, starter zones, preserved room IDs, area/zone assignments, and vnums. Live world package files are not modified.

Builder JSON imports are staged from `worlds/<world_id>/builder/imports/` with `builder import list`, `builder import validate <file>`, `builder import preview <file>`, and `builder import apply <file> [--merge|--replace-drafts]`. The import/export bundle contains `areas`, `zones`, `rooms`, `features`, `items`, `entities`, and `spawns` so draft data can round-trip through `builder export` and import validation.

## Phase 4F Hotfix: committed organized starter drafts

Fresh downloads now include the organized Shattered Realms starter Builder drafts under `worlds/shattered_realms/builder/`. The live package files remain unchanged; the committed Builder drafts are the default editable organized starter layer that Builder Mode overlays at runtime.

Use `builder validate` to verify the committed starter draft layer. The starting room `guildhall_crossing_square` is assigned to `starter_guildlands`, zone `guildhall_crossing`, vnum `1000`, and should report `Status: organized` in `rstat`.

`builder migrate starter` remains available to reset or regenerate the starter drafts from the live Shattered Realms package. Regeneration should update the draft JSON files only; do not commit runtime audit, history, snapshot, export, local database, or user-data artifacts.

To exchange the organized starter layer, run `builder export`, then place the exported bundle in the Builder import folder and run `builder import validate <file>` before applying it.


## Phase 4G Contract Freeze

World packages are v1-compatible with the canonical contract in `WORLD_DATA_SPECIFICATION.md`. Existing area, zone, room, item, entity, feature, and spawn collections remain valid; optional future files such as `locations.json` and profile libraries are additive and not required for current worlds.

## Phase 5A runtime content synchronization

Phase 5A establishes one canonical runtime truth. Item templates and entity templates are definitions only; `item_placements` and `spawns` are declarations; SQLite item/entity rows are live instances. Room rendering, look/examine, get/take, diagnostics, and future perception use canonical runtime room contents. Shared `feature_refs` resolve nonportable scenery alongside local room `features`. Blacksmith Stall now uses an anvil feature, two materialized Iron Sword item instances, one materialized Training Sword item instance, and one materialized Blacksmith Harl entity instance.


## Entity placement compatibility

Phase 5A makes legacy NPC declarations compatibility and diagnostic sources only. Legacy room NPC arrays and entity-template default rooms normalize into deterministic canonical spawn declarations, materialize into SQLite `entity_instances`, and then normal rendering, targeting, dialogue, look, scan, search, and movement-room rendering consume runtime instances only. Builder diagnostics may still show templates, spawns, legacy declarations, and materialization records separately.

Canonical spawns supersede equivalent legacy declarations by world, room, template, and compatible quantity. Display-name deduplication is not allowed because legitimate same-name runtime instances must remain visible. Upgraded databases adopt one matching existing runtime row into the materialization record and report ambiguous extras as duplicate candidates instead of deleting or hiding them.

## Phase 5B package additions

Runtime package loading recognizes schedules plus living-world seed/profile collections for deterministic simulation authoring.

## Phase 6C ability package collections

World packages may include `abilities/abilities.json`, `ability_loadouts/ability_loadouts.json`, `ability_schools/ability_schools.json`, `ability_categories/ability_categories.json`, `cooldown_groups/cooldown_groups.json`, `targeting_profiles/targeting_profiles.json`, `healing_profiles/healing_profiles.json`, and `casting_profiles/casting_profiles.json`. Matching Builder drafts live directly under `worlds/<world_id>/builder/`.


## Phase 6D deterministic combat behavior

Phase 6D introduces canonical NPC combat behavior profiles, hostility evaluation, threat tables, deterministic action candidates, assist/protect/flee/surrender/call-for-help/pursuit hooks, pet modes, and Builder/Admin diagnostics. The system is a validator and selector only: AbilityExecutionService continues to own ability validation, costs, cooldowns, casts, healing, damage components, and effects; CombatEngine continues to own basic attack resolution and lifecycle handoff. Generative AI is not required for combat, and future AI suggestions cannot bypass deterministic validation.


## Phase 6E Progression Integration

Canonical progression is now represented by `engine.progression.ProgressionService`, SQLite `actor_progression_state`, XP/currency/grant history tables, and world package collections for species, races, classes, tracks, professions, curves, progression profiles, and growth profiles. Quest, loot, trainer, crafting, faction, and final balance systems remain separate and must award progression only through canonical APIs.

## Phase 7A reward collections

World packages may now include `reward_definitions`, `loot_tables`, `treasure_groups`, `death_loot_profiles`, `corpse_decay_profiles`, `resource_node_profiles`, `currency_profiles`, `reward_message_profiles`, `reward_eligibility_profiles`, and `reward_delivery_profiles`. Omitted collections remain valid for backward compatibility.

## Phase 7B Economy Integration

Phase 7B adds the canonical `engine.economy.EconomyService` for SQLite-authoritative carried balances, immutable ledger entries, price quotes, transactions, shop stock, buyback records, identify/repair service payments, bank accounts, and currency conversion. Economy world data is authored in the dedicated currency, shop, stock, policy, pricing, service, repair, bank, restock, message, and eligibility collections. Reward, item, progression, Actor, command, package, Builder, and roadmap systems integrate by calling EconomyService APIs rather than directly mutating money, stock, item ownership, bank records, or service state. Crafting, trainers, quests, auctions, player trading, and autonomous AI economics remain explicitly deferred.

## Phase 7C crafting integration

Phase 7C adds `engine.crafting.CraftingService` as the single canonical crafting and production service. Recipes are Builder/world-package data; exact runtime item instances are selected and reserved; jobs persist in SQLite and advance by world time; costs use EconomyService; outputs use RewardService; profession rewards use canonical profession/progression state; and crafted item instances retain quality and provenance without mutating item templates. Salvaging and refining are normal recipe types, while quests, final trainers, autonomous AI production, random affixes, auction houses, and final enchantment remain outside this phase.


## Phase 8A Quest Integration

Phase 8A introduces `engine.quests.QuestService`, `QuestEventRouter`, `ConversationService`, and `WorldStateService` as the canonical quest and authored narrative-state foundation. Quests are Builder/world-package data, consume canonical EventBus-style events idempotently, branch deterministically, persist runtime state in SQLite, and hand rewards to RewardService instead of mutating items, XP, currencies, abilities, progression, Actor stats, or world records directly. Future AI may propose text or actions, but QuestService validates all outcomes; unrestricted scripts remain forbidden.

## Phase 8B Organization Integration

Phase 8B adds the canonical `OrganizationService` for parties, guilds, clans, NPC organizations, roles, permissions, invitations, applications, shared quest context, group combat attribution, and organization audit history. These systems provide context only and call existing canonical services for combat, quests, rewards, economy, progression, crafting, and world state.
